    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi! I’m Gemma Galecia, a Business Analytics professional with a Master’s in Information Technology (Business Analytics) 
      and over a decade of experience in higher education administration.As a Computer Science Graduate Program Secretary at 
      UMass Boston, I support academic leadership, streamline departmental operations, and analyze student data to improve 
      processes and decision-making. I’m skilled in SQL, Python, Tableau, Power BI, and Excel, and I’ve applied these tools in 
      projects like predictive modeling, financial analytics, and building a Spotify music recommendation system.</p>

    <p>I’ve been recognized with the CSM Staff Excellence Award (2020), earned Outstanding and Distinction honors in 
        my IT program, and won first place in my capstone class competition.</p>
    
    <p>I’m now looking to transition into a Business Analytics role, where I can combine my analytical skills and operational
      experience to drive data-informed decisions. Outside of work, I enjoy cruising, strategy games, and exploring graphic 
      design projects.</p>
